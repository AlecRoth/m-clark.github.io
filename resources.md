# Learning Commonly Used Statistical Programs

<span class="">[UCLA ATS](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/)</span>: While somewhat dated in appearance, this has been a good resource for those starting out with statistical programming, and has been for a very long time.

<span class="">[princeton dss](http://libguides.princeton.edu/dss)</span>: a similar resource.

# R
[R example repository](http://www.uni-kiel.de/psychologie/rexrepos/)
