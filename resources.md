This will be a list especially geared toward something I can point clients/researchers to.  It is very much in the early stages, but I will probably try to keep it brief anyway so that it can be quickly and lightly perused.


# Learning Commonly Used Statistical Programs

[UCLA ATS](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/): While somewhat dated in appearance, this has been a good resource for those starting out with statistical programming, and has been for a very long time.

[princeton dss](http://libguides.princeton.edu/dss): a similar resource.

# R

## Learning
[R example repository](http://www.uni-kiel.de/psychologie/rexrepos/)

[Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/) Learn R in R, interactively.

My Intro notes

## Specific techniques and tools

[Use R series](http://www.springer.com/series/6991): for umich folks, this is electronically [available](http://mirlyn.lib.umich.edu/Search/Home?lookfor=%22%20Use%20R!%22&type=series)

[Awesome R](https://github.com/qinwf/awesome-R) A notably lengthy 'awesome' list for R stuff, in case you have an afternoon to spare.  Essentially a complement of [CRAN Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/).

## Misc

[RSeek](http://rseek.org/) R specific search engine.

[Rbloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/)  Tons of blogs about R.

[Ropensci](https://ropensci.org/) Packages for Open Science.

[Hadleyverse](http://barryrowlingson.github.io/hadleyverse/) A nice summary.



# Python

[Statsmodels](http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) Standard statistical models in Python.

[Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)  Simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.

[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) Dealing with data in an R-like way.

[Compared to R for stats](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/05/r-vs-python-data-science.html)


# Stata
[Stata forums](http://www.statalist.org/forums)

[Stata blog](http://blog.stata.com/)

# Mplus
[Mplus forums](https://www.statmodel.com/cgi-bin/discus/discus.cgi)

For SPSS users that use the Processing macro, [all of processing models and then some in Mplus syntax](http://offbeat.group.shef.ac.uk/FIO/mplusmedmod.htm ) (and hence, lavaan in R)


# Programming (general)
[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) (look for specific program [tag](http://stackoverflow.com/tags))

# Statistics
[Cross-validated](http://stats.stackexchange.com/)

## SEM/psychometrics
Revelle's site for [psychometrics](http://www.personality-project.org/r/book/)

[SEM Workshop notes](http://m-clark.github.io/docs/sem/) (mostly using lavaan)

## Mixed Models
