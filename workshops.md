Here you'll find workshop slides and similar.  They are roughly in order of how recently they've been given.  Some are not so much workshops as talks without any expectation of hands-on exercises or similar.


## Current

<span itemscope itemtype ="http://schema.org/TechArticle">
[<span itemprop="name">Mixed Models with R</span>](../workshops/mixed_models_r/)  This workshop focuses on mixed effects models using R, covering basic random effects models (random intercepts and slopes) as well as extensions into generalized mixed models and discussion of realms beyond.
</span>

<span itemscope itemtype ="http://schema.org/TechArticle">
[<span itemprop="name">My God, it's full of STARs! Using astrology to get more from your data.</span>](../workshops/stars/)  Talk on structured additive regression models, and generalized additive models in particular.
</span>

<span itemscope itemtype ="http://schema.org/TechArticle">
[<span itemprop="name">Data Processing and Visualization in R</span>](../workshops/DataProcViz/)     
Focus is on common <span itemprop="keywords">data processing</span> and exploration techniques, especially as a prelude to <span itemprop="keywords">visualization</span>.  The main focus will be the <span itemprop="keywords">dplyr</span> and <span itemprop="keywords">data.table</span> packages, which enhance and facilitate the sorts of operations that typically arise when dealing with data, including faster <span itemprop="keywords">I/O</span> and grouped operations.  For visualization, the focus will be on using <span itemprop="keywords">ggplot2</span> and other packages that allow for interactivity. [Exercises](../workshops/DataProcViz/Exercises.html).
</span>

<span itemscope itemtype ="http://schema.org/TechArticle">
[<span itemprop="name keywords">Structural Equation Modeling</span>](../docs/sem/)  
This document regards a recent workshop given on <span itemprop="keywords">structural equation modeling</span>.  It is conceptually based, and tries to generalize beyond the standard SEM treatment. The document should be useful to anyone interested in the techniques covered, though it is R-based, with special emphasis on the [<span itemprop="keywords">lavaan</span>](http://lavaan.ugent.be/) package.
</span>

<span itemscope itemtype ="http://schema.org/TechArticle">
[<span itemprop="name keywords">Become a Bayesian in 10 Minutes</span>](../workshops/bayesian/)  
This document regards a talk aimed at giving an introduction <span itemprop="keywords">Bayesian modeling</span> in <span itemprop="keywords">R</span> via the <span itemprop="keywords">Stan</span> programming language.  It doesn't assume too much statistically or any prior Bayesian experience.  For those with such experience, they can quickly work with the code or packages discussed.  I post them here because they exist and provide a quick overview, but you'd get more from the more extensive [document](../docs/IntroBayes.html).
</span>

<span itemscope itemtype ="http://schema.org/TechArticle">
[<span itemprop="name">Ceci nâ€™est pas une %>%</span>](../workshops/dplyr/mainSlides.html)      
Exploring your data with <span itemprop="keywords">R</span>. A workshop that introduces some newer modes of <span itemprop="keywords">data wrangling</span> within R, with an eye toward <span itemprop="keywords">visualization</span>. Focus on <span itemprop="keywords">dplyr</span> and <span itemprop="keywords">magrittr</span> packages.
</span>

<span itemscope itemtype ="http://schema.org/TechArticle">
[<span itemprop="name">Getting More from RStudio</span>](../docs/introRstudio.html)    
An afternoon talk on how to use <span itemprop="keywords">RStudio</span> for more than just coding.
</span>



## Under development


<span itemscope itemtype ="http://schema.org/TechArticle">
[<span itemprop="name">Literate Statistical Programming</span>](../docs/RDA_intro.pdf)     
A presentation on <span itemprop="keywords">literate programming</span> and <span itemprop="keywords">reproducible research</span>. Introduces key concepts with demonstration via RStudio using <span itemprop="keywords">Rmarkdown</span>, $\LaTeX$, R etc. This set of notes regarded a talk given with Andres Martinez, but I hope to return to it at some point for an update and extension.
</span>


## Other

<span itemscope itemtype ="http://schema.org/TechArticle">
[<span itemprop="name">R Bootcamp</span>](../workshops/r_bootcamp/master.html)    
An afternoon workshop I hope to develop further at some point.
