[<span itemprop="name keywords">Structural Equation Modeling</span>](../docs/sem/) This document regards a recent workshop given on <span itemprop="keywords">structural equation modeling</span>.  It is conceptually based, and tries to generalize beyond the standard SEM treatment. It is a work in progress, particularly the sections after the <span itemprop="keywords">SEM</span> 'chapter'.  The initial workshop was given to an audience comprising in-person and remote participants, but the document should be useful to anyone interested in the techniques covered. It is completely R-based, with special emphasis on the [<span itemprop="keywords">lavaan</span>](http://lavaan.ugent.be/) package.
