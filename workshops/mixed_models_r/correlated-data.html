<h2>Random Intercepts model</h2>
<p>For the following weâll demonstrate the simplest<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and most common case of a mixed model, that in which we have a single random effect added to the standard regression situation. For reasons that will hopefully become clear later, this is commonly called a random intercepts model. We will see an extension of it later.</p>

<div id="example-student-gpa" class="section level2">
<h2>Example: student GPA</h2>
<p>For the following weâll assess factors predicting college grade point average (GPA). Each of the 200 students is assessed for six occasions (each semester for the first three years), so we have observations nested within students. We have other variables such as job status, sex, and high school GPA. Some will be in both labeled and numeric form. See the <a href="appendix.html#appendix">appendix</a> for details.</p>

<div id="the-standard-regression-model" class="section level2">
<h2>The standard regression model</h2>
<p>Now for the underlying model. We can show it in a couple different ways. First we start with just a standard regression to get our bearings.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathscr{gpa} = b_{\mathrm{intercept}} + b_{\mathrm{occ}}\cdot \mathscr{occasion} + \epsilon\]</span></p>
<p>We have coefficients for the intercept and the effect of time. The error <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and some standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\epsilon \sim \mathscr{N}(0, \sigma)\]</span></p>
<p>An alternate way to write the model which puts emphasis on the underlying data generating process for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathscr{gpa} \sim \mathscr{N}(\mu, \sigma)\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\mu = b_{\mathrm{intercept}} + b_{\mathrm{occ}}\cdot \mathscr{occasion}\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="the-mixed-model" class="section level2">
<h2>The mixed model</h2>
<div id="initial-depiction" class="section level5">
<h5>Initial depiction</h5>
<p>Now we show one way of showing it as a mixed model that includes a unique effect for each student. Consider the following model for a single student<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. This depiction shows that the student-specific effect can be seen as an additional source of variance.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathscr{gpa} = b_{\mathrm{intercept}} + b_{\mathrm{occ}}\cdot \mathscr{occasion} + (\mathrm{effect}_{\mathscr{student}} + \epsilon)\]</span> If we rearrange it, we can instead focus on model coefficients.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathscr{gpa} = (b_{\mathrm{intercept}} + \mathrm{effect}_{\mathscr{student}}) + b_{\mathrm{occ}}\cdot \mathscr{occasion} +  \epsilon\]</span></p>
<p>In this way, weâll have student-specific intercepts, as each person will have their own unique effect added to the overall intercept, resulting in a different intercept for each person. As such this is often called a random intercepts model.</p>
<p>In either case, we (usually) assume the following for the student effects.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathrm{effect}_{\mathrm{student}} \sim \mathscr{N}(0, \tau)\]</span></p>
<p>Thus the student effects are random, and specifically are normally distributed with mean of zero and some estimated standard deviation. In other words, conceptually the only difference between the mixed model and a standard regression is the student effect, which is <em>on average</em> no effect, but specifically varies from student to student with some standard deviation (<span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>).</p>
</div>
<div id="as-a-multi-level-model" class="section level5">
<h5>As a multi-level model</h5>
<p>This next depiction is commonly seen in the multilevel modeling literature. It is shown as a two part model, one at the observation level and one at the student level.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathrm{gpa} = b_{\mathrm{int\_student}} + b_{\mathrm{occ}}\cdot \mathrm{occasion} + \epsilon\]</span></p>

<p>However, after âplugging inâ the second level part to the first, it is identical to the previous.</p>
<p>Note how we donât have a student-specific effect for occasion. In this context, occasion is said to be a fixed effect only, and there is no random component. This definitely does not have to be the case though, as weâll see later.</p>

<p>All student paths are shown in blue, with a sample of 10 shown in orange. The overall trend as estimated by the regression weâll do later is shown in red. Two things stand out. One is that students have a lot of variability in starting out. Secondly, while the general trend in GPA is upward over time as weâd expect, individual students may vary in that trajectory.</p>

<p>The above tells us that as we move from semester to semester, we can expect GPA to increase by about 0.11 points. This would be fine except that we are ignoring the clustering. A side effect of doing so is that our standard errors are incorrect, and thus claims about statistical significance based on them would be off. More importantly however is that we simply donât get to explore the student effect, which would be of interest by itself.</p>
</div>
<div id="regression-by-cluster" class="section level4">
<h4>Regression by cluster</h4>
<p>An alternative approach would be to run separate regressions for every student. However, there are many drawbacks to this- itâs not easily summarized when there are many groups, typically there would be very little data within each cluster to do so, and the models are over-contextualized, meaning they ignore what students have in common. Weâll compare this result to the mixed model later.</p>
</div>
<div id="mixed-model" class="section level4">
<h4>Mixed model</h4>
<p>Next we run a mixed model that will allow for a student specific effect. Such a model is easily conducted in R, specifically with the package <span class="pack">lme4</span>. In the following, the code will look just like what you used for regression with <span class="func">lm</span>, but with an additional component specifying the group effect. The <code>(1|student)</code> means that we are allowing the intercept, represented by <code>1</code>, to vary by student. With the mixed model, we get the same results as the regression, but with more to talk about.</p>

<p>First we see that the coefficients for the intercept and time are the same<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, as would be their interpretation. The standard errors, on the other hand are different here, though in the end our conclusion as far as statistical significance goes would be the same. However, the <span class="pack">lme4</span> does not provide p-values. There is a reason for this, namely that with mixed models we are essentially dealing with two sample sizes, the N cluster and N observations, the effective degrees of freedom lies somewhere in between. Other programs provide p-values as if there is no issue, and without telling you <em>which</em> approach they use to calculate them (there are several). However, itâs easy enough to get confidence intervals with <span class="pack">lme4</span> as follows.</p>

<p>One thing thatâs new compared to the standard regression output is the estimated variance/standard deviation of the student effect (<span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> in our formula depiction from before). This tells us how much, on average, GPA bounces around as we move from student to student. In other words, even after making a prediction based on time point, each student has their own unique deviation, and that value is the estimated average deviation. Note that scores move due to the student more than double what they move based on a semester change.</p>
<p>Whatâs more, we can actually get estimates of the student effects. I show two ways for the first five students, as random effect and as random intercept (i.e.Â effect + intercept).</p>

<p>Note that we did not allow occasion to vary, so it is a constant, i.e.Â fixed, effect for all students.</p>
<p>Another way to interpret the variance output is via the <span class="emph">intraclass correlation</span>, which tells us how much of the variance is due to the clustering. In this case itâs just the student variance out of the total, or 0.064 / 0.122 = 52.3%.</p>

<h2>Cluster level covariate</h2>
<p>Note our depiction of a mixed model as a multilevel model.</p>

<p><span class="math display">\[b_{\mathrm{int\_student}} = b_{\mathrm{intercept}} + \mathrm{effect}_{\mathrm{student}}\]</span> If we add student a student level covariate, e.g sex, to the model, we then have the following.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[b_{\mathrm{int\_student}} = b_{\mathrm{intercept}} + b_{sex}\cdot \mathrm{sex} +  \mathrm{effect}_{\mathrm{student}}\]</span></p>

<p>Thus, adding cluster level covariates doesnât have any unusual effect on how we think about the model<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. We simply add them to our set of predictor variables. Note also, that we can create cluster level covariates as means or some other summary of the observation level variables. This is especially common when the clusters represent geographical units and observations are people.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Mixed models allow for us to take into account clustering in the data. If this were all it was used for, we would have more accurate inference relative to what would be had if we ignored the structure in the data. However, we get much more. We better understand the sources of variability in the target variable. We also get group specific estimates of the parameters in the model, allowing us to understand exactly how the groups differ from one another. Furthermore, this in turn allows for group specific prediction, and much more accurate prediction. In short, there is much to be gained by mixed models, even in the simplest of settings.</p>

<h3>Sleep</h3>
<p>For this exercise, weâll use the sleep study data from the <span class="pack">lme4</span> package. The following describes it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The average reaction time per day for subjects in a sleep deprivation study. On day 0 the subjects had their normal amount of sleep. Starting that night they were restricted to 3 hours of sleep per night. The observations represent the average reaction time (in milliseconds) on a series of tests given each day to each subject.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After loading the package, the data can be loaded as follows. I show the first few observations.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Actually, the simplest model would have no covariates at all, just <span class="emph">variance components</span>, with no correlations among the random effects. Such a model can be interesting to look at while exploring your data, but would probably never suffice on its own to tell the story you desire to.<a href="correlated-data.html#fnref1">â©</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Note that I leave out the observation level subscript to keep things clean. I find that multilevel style notation quickly becomes unwieldy, and donât wish to reproduce it. It also tends to add confusion to a lot of applied researchers starting out with mixed models.<a href="correlated-data.html#fnref2">â©</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>This will not always be the case, e.g.Â with unbalanced data, but they should be fairly close.<a href="correlated-data.html#fnref3">â©</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>This is why the multilevel depiction is subpar, and leads many to confusion at times. You have a target variable and predictor variables based on theory. Whether they are cluster level variables or if there are interactions doesnât have anything to do with the data structure as much as it does the theoretical implications. However, if you depict the model in multilevel fashion, the final model must adhere to the âplugged inâ result. So if, e.g.Â you posit a cluster level variable for a random slope, you <em>must</em> include the implied interaction of the cluster level and observation level covariates.<a href="correlated-data.html#fnref4">â©</a></p></li>
