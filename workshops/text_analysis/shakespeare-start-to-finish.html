<h1>Shakespeare Start to Finish</h1>
<p>The following attempts to demonstrate the usual difficulties in dealing with text by procuring and processing the works of Shakespeare. The source is <a href="http://shakespeare.mit.edu/">MIT</a> which has made the âcompleteâ works available on the web since 1993, plus one other from Gutenberg. The initial issue is simply getting the works from the web. Subsequently there is metadata, character names, stopwords etc. to be removed. At that point we can stem and count the words in each work, which, when complete, puts us at the point we are ready for analysis.</p>
<p>The primary packages used are <span class="pack">tidytext</span>, <span class="pack">stringr</span>, and when things are ready for analysis, <span class="pack">quanteda.</span></p>

<h2>ACT I. Scrape Moby and Gutenberg Shakespeare</h2>
<div id="scene-i.-scrape-main-works" class="section level3">
<h3>Scene I. Scrape main works</h3>
<p>Initially we must scrape the web to get the documents we need. The <span class="pack">rvest</span> package will be used as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with the url of the site</li>
<li>Get the links off that page to serve as base urls for the works</li>
<li>Scrape the document for each url</li>
<li>Deal with the collection of Sonnets separately</li>
<li>Write out results</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we just paste the main site url to the work urls and download them. Here is where we come across our first snag. The <span class="func">html_text</span> function has what I would call a bug but what the author feels is a feature. <a href="https://github.com/hadley/rvest/issues/175">Basically it ignores line breaks of the form <br> in certain situations</a>. This means it will smash text together that shouldnât be, thereby making <em>any</em> analysis of it fairly useless<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>.

<h3>Scene V. Add additional works</h3>
<p>It is typical to be gathering texts from multiple sources. In this case, weâll get <em>The Phoenix and the Turtle</em> from the Gutenberger website. There is an R package that will allow us to work directly with the site, making the process straightforward<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>. I also considered two other works, but I refrained from âThe Two Noble Kinsmenâ because like many other of Shakespeareâs versions on Gutenberg, itâs basically written in a different language. I also refrained from <em>The Passionate Pilgrim</em> because itâs mostly not Shakespeare.</p>
<p>When first doing this project, I actually started with Gutenberg, but it became a notable PITA. The texts were inconsistent in source, and sometimes reproduced printing errors purposely, which would have compounded typical problems. I thought it could have been solved by using the <em>Complete Works of Shakespeare</em> but the download only came with that title, meaning one would have to hunt for and delineate each separate work. This might not have been too big of an issue, except that there is no table of contents, nor consistent naming of titles across different printings. The MIT approach, on the other hand, was a few lines of code. This represents a common issue in text analysis when dealing with sources, a different option may save a lot of time in the end.</p>
<p>The following code could be more succinct to deal with one text, but I initially was dealing with multiple works, so Iâve left it in that mode. In the end weâll have a <span class="objclass">tibble</span> with an id column for the file/work name, and another column that contains the lines of text.</p>

<h2>ACT III. Stop words</h2>
<p>As weâve noted before, weâll want to get rid of stop words, things like articles, possessive pronouns, and other very common words. In this case, we also want to include character names. However, the big wrinkle here is that this is not everyday English, so we need to get ye, thee, thine etc. In addition there are things that need to be replaced like oâer to over, which may then also be removed. In short, this is not so straightforward.</p>

<p>Stemming will make words like eye and eyes just <em>ey</em>, or convert war, wars and warring to <em>war</em>. In other words it will reduce variations of a word to a common root form, or âword stemâ. We could have done this in a step prior to counting the terms, but then you only have the stemmed result to work with for the document term matrix from then on. Depending on your situation, you may or may not want to stem, or maybe youâd want to compare results. The <span class="pack">quanteda</span> package will actually stem with the DTM and collapse the word counts accordingly. I note the difference in words before and after.</p>

<h4>Similarity</h4>
<p>The <span class="pack">quanteda</span> package has some built in similarity measures such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity">cosine similarity</a>, which you can treat similarly to the standard correlation (also available).

<p>We can already begin to see the clusters of documents. For example, the more historical are the clump in the upper left. The oddball is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phoenix_and_the_Turtle"><em>The Phoenix and the Turtle</em></a>, though <em>Loverâs Complaint</em> and the <em>Elegy</em> are also less similar than standard Shakespeare. The Phoenix and the Turtle is about the death of ideal love, represented by the Phoenix and Turtledove, for which there is a funeral. It actually is considered by scholars to be in stark constrast to his other output. Elegy itself is actually written for a funeral. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Lover%27s_Complaint"><em>A Loverâs Complaint</em></a> is considered an inferior work by the Bard, so perhaps what weâre seeing is a reflection of that lack of quality. In geneal, weâre seeing things that we might expect.</p>

<h4>Readability</h4>
<p>We can examine readablity scores for the texts, but for this weâll need them in raw form. We already had them from before, I just added <em>Phoenix</em> from the Gutenberg download.</p>

<p>With raw texts, we need to make them an official <span class="objclass">corpus</span> object to proceed more easily. The <span class="func">corpus</span> function from <span class="pack">quanteda</span> wonât read directly from a list column or a list at all, so weâll convert it via the <span class="pack">tm</span> package, which more or less defeats the purpose of using the <span class="pack">quanteda</span> package except that the <span class="func">textstat_readability</span> function gives us what we want, but I digress.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the concept of <span class="emph">readability</span> is ill-defined, and as such, there are dozens of measures available dating back nearly 75 years. The following is based on the Coleman-Liau grade score (higher grade = more difficult). The conclusion here is first, Shakespeare isnât exactly a difficult read, and two, the poems may be more so relative to the other works.</p>

<h4>Lexical diversity</h4>
<p>There are also metrics of <span class="emph">lexical diversity</span>. As with readability, there is no one way to measure âdiversityâ. Here weâll go back to using the standard DTM, as the focus is on the terms, whereas readibility is more at the sentence level. Most standard measures of lexical diversity are variants on what is called the type-token ratio, which in our setting is the number of unique terms (types) relative to the total terms (tokens). We can use <span class="func">textstat_lexdiv</span> for our purposes here, which will provide several measures of diversity by default.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">ld =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">textstat_lexdiv</span>(shakes_dtm)</code></pre></div>
<p>This visual is based on the (absolute) scaled values of those several metrics, and might suggest that the poems are relatively more diverse. This certainly might be the case for <em>Phoenix</em>, but it could also be a reflection of the limitation of several of the measures, such that longer works are seen as less diverse, as tokens are added more so than types the longer the text goes.</p>

It is notably less affected by text length, though the conclusions are largely the same.

<p>We can see there is a lot of overlap in these topics for top terms. Just looking at the top 10, <em>love</em> occurs in all of them, <em>god</em> and <em>heart</em> as well, but we could have guessed this just looking at how often they occur in general. Other measures can be used to assess term importance, such as those that seek to balance the termâs probability of occurrence within a document, and term <em>exclusivity</em>, or how likely a term is to occur in only one particular topic. See the <span class="pack">stm</span> package and corresponding <span class="func">labelTopics</span> function as a way to get several alternatives. As an example I show the results of their version of the following<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="emph">FREX</span>: <strong>fr</strong>equency and <strong>ex</strong>clusivity, it is a weighted harmonic mean of a termâs rank within a topic in terms of frequency and exclusivity</li>
<li><span class="emph">lift</span>: ratio of the termn=âs probability within a topic to its probability of occurrence across all documents. Overly sensitive to rare words.</li>
<li><span class="emph">score</span>: another approach that will give more weight to exclusive terms</li>
<li><span class="emph">prob</span>: This is just the raw probability of the term within a given topic.</li>

<p>As another approach, consider the <span class="emph">saliency</span> and <span class="emph">relevance</span> of term via the <span class="pack">LDAvis</span> package. While you can play with it here, itâs probably easier to <a href="vis/index.html">open it separately</a>.</p>

<p>For example, base just on term frequency, Hamlet is most likely to be associated with Topic 2. That topic is associated with the (stemmed words) love, ey, night, heart, life, hand, plai, hear, natur, poor, sweet, stand, follow, true, fear, prai, death, hold, friend, dai. Hamlet is also one that is actually a decent mix, with its second topic expressed being Topic 1, with common terms love, night, god, heart, hear, hand, heaven, world, prai, marri, friend, fortun, madam, soul, death, matter, live, ey, honest, nobl. They both have love, ey, night, heart, hand, hear, prai, death, friend among their top 20 terms. Sounds about right for Hamlet. The other measures pick up on things like Dane and Denmark.</p>
<p>The following visualization shows a heatmap for the topic probabilities of each document. Darker values mean higher probability for a document expressing that topic. Iâve also added a cluster analysis based on the cosine distance matrix, and the resulting dendrogram<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>. The colored bar on the right represents the given classification of a work as history, tragedy, comedy, or poem.</p>

<p>A couple things stand out. To begin with, most works are associated with one topic. In terms of the discovered topics, traditional classificiation really probably only works for the historical works, as they cluster together as expected (except for Henry the VIII, possibly due to it being a collaborative work). Furthermore, tragedies and comedies might hit on the same topics, albeit from different perspecitves. In addition, at least some works are very poetical, or at least have topics in common with the poems (love). If we take four clusters, the result boils down to <em>Phoenix</em> (on its own), standard poems, a mixed bag of more love oriented works and the remaining poems, then everything else.</p>
<p>Alternatively, one could merely classify the works based on their probable topics, which would make more sense if clustering of the works is in fact the goal. The following visualization attempts to order them based on their most probable topic. The order is based on the most likely topics across all documents.</p>

<li id="fn10"><p>I found it easier to work with the entire data frame for the function, hence splitting it on id and recombining. Some attempt was made to work within the tidyverse, but there were numerous issues to what should have been a fairly easy task.<a href="shakespeare-start-to-finish.html#fnref10">â©</a></p></li>

<li id="fn15"><p>If you are actually interested in clustering the documents (or anything for that matter in my opinion), this would not be the way to do so. For one, the documents are already clustered based on most probable topic. Second, cosine distance isnât actually a proper distance. Third, as shocking as it may seem, newer methods have been developed since the hierarchical clustering approach, which basically has a dozen arbitrary choices to be made at each step. However, as a simple means to a visualization, the method is valuable if it helps with understanding the data.<a href="shakespeare-start-to-finish.html#fnref15">â©</a></p></li>
