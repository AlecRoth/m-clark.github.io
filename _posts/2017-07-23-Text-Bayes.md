title: Topic Modeling and Bayes
---

- New Docs: [<span itemprop="name keywords">Topic Modeling Demo</span>](../docs/topic_models/topic-model-demo.html) offers a hands-on look at topic modeling in an attempt to make a little more clearer what's going on behind the scenes.  A more applied workshop on text analysis (including topic modeling) is currently in the finishing stages.

In addition, [<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bayesian Basics</span>](../docs/bayesian_book/) has been updated yet again.  New format that I'm finally satisfied with, and I think those using it will appreciate.
