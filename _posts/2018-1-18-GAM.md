title: Generalized Additive Models
---

- Updates: My document on [generalized additive models](https://m-clark.github.io/generalized-additive-models) has been notably updated.  To begin, it is now in bookdown format, which probably makes for a little bit easier navigation.  In addition, I've added more details, which spawned a 'technical details' section that breaks down basis functions and other aspects of the models, and cleaned up other content.

- Workshops: Upcoming workshops include Mixed Models, and possibly SEM if there is enough interest.  One new workshop on R Markdown is currently in development to be given sometime in March or thereabouts.
