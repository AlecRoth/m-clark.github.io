title: Machine Learning

- Updated Document: [<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Introduction to Machine Learning</span>](../docs/machine_learning/). The first doc I did with $\LaTeX$ / Sweave, but I hadn't updated it in a very long time.  It's for those in applied disciplines that would have standard statistical training but probably no exposure to machine learning approaches.  The document is now in html format via Rmarkdown, with some update to the content throughout.

- Aside from that, I'd noticed I never linked one of my (many) documents regarding mixed models, so that's been added to the documents section also.

- Finally, updated code section to reflect some recent additions.
