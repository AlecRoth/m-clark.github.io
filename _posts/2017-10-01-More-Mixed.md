title: Mixed Models revisited
---

- New Docs/Workshops: [<span itemprop="name keywords">Mixed Models with R</span>](../mixed-models-with-R/) has been updated with content for the current version of the workshop.  In addition, I've updated a document [comparing mixed models and latent growth curve models](../mixed-growth-comparison/), showing their equivalence under a variety of model settings.
