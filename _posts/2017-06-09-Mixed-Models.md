title: Mixed Models
---

- New Workshop: [<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mixed Models with R</span>](../workshops/mixed_models_R/). I'll be giving a short workshop on campus next week on mixed models, but took the opportunity to lay the groundwork for a more extensive one (day long) that will probably be given in the fall.

- Other: Added some content to the [Categorical Regression Models](../docs/logregmodels.html) document, as well as added related code to [repo](https://github.com/m-clark/Miscellaneous-R-Code).  Added brief discussion on Heckman selection model to the [SEM document](../docs/sem/)
