- Updated the [R Markdown document](https://m-clark.github.io/Introduction-to-Rmarkdown/) with some extended content in the appendix (e.g. citations), and some minor addition/clarification throughout the text. 

- Broke off part of my lazerhawk package to its own- [tidyext](https://m-clark.github.io/tidyext).  These are tidy extras/extensions that do some common data processing steps within the tidy realm.
