title: Text Analysis
---

- New Docs/Workshops: [<span itemprop="name keywords">Text Analysis with R</span>](../workshops/text_analysis/) provides an introduction to dealing with text in a variety ways in the R environment, including basic string manipulation, sentiment analysis, POS tagging, and topic modeling. Packages used include tidytext and quanteda among others.  It's actually not quite complete, but fairly close.  I also hope to add some Python demos in the not to distant future.

- Upcoming workshops:  In September/October I'll be giving workshops on mixed models and structural equation modeling, and as such the associated docs for those will eventually have minor updates as well.
