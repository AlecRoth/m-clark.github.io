title: Clustered data
---
Content added:

- Added Doc: [<span style="font-variant:small-caps; font-style:italic;">Clustered data situations</span>](../docs/clustered/). Added a document comparing various approaches to dealing with situations where the units of observation exhibit some grouping structure and are thus not independent.  Considered are standard linear model, cluster robust standard errors, fixed effect models, random effects models, generalized estimating equations, and latent growth curves.
