- Updates: Long overdue updating of links on the [Code][code] page.

- New: My annual dive into the frustration of Shiny has produced an [app to explore historical football/soccer data](https://micl.shinyapps.io/football/) for various European leagues and MLS.  Something to play around with while the U.S. is not playing in the World Cup.

- In progress: Updating the [Data Processing and Visualization][workshops] notes by separating it into two workshops, though still a single document, and now in bookdown format (not released yet).

- Upcoming workshops will start in November and include Data Processing, Text Analysis, Visualization, Machine Learning (with Marcio Mourao), and maybe one or two for December not yet announced.

- Other: Currently updating various documents to use github pages so updates on this site are automatic.  This will change the links, but they will be current here.
