Part of my job entails analysis or consulting on various research projects with differing levels of involvement. I note the ones I am/was more involved with here.

## Current

As of early 2019. Primary researcher in parenthesis.

[Readiness of Trauma Surgeons](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/lhs/brian-c-george-md) (Brian George)

[Sleep Disorders in Youth after Adenotonsillectomy](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ronald_Chervin) (Ronald Chervin)

[Library Learning Analytics Project](https://libraryanalytics.org/) (Felix Kabo)



## Past

[Longitudinal Study of Health and Survival in the Dogon of Mali](http://sites.lsa.umich.edu/bis/research/) (Beverly Strassmann)

[Youth Depression and Suicide Prevention Program](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/king-lab/) (Cheryl King)

[Baboon Social Affiliation](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1793/20141261.short) (Beth Archie) This led me down a path in which I've consulted on research involving baboons, macaques, chimps, geladas, etc., which I find can be kind of fun.
