Some of the things I spend some time on such as research, technical documents, or even just some fun things I might do with some code on the side. Still in progress of migration.

# Projects

As of Spring 2016. Primary researcher in parenthesis.

[Youth Depression and Suicide Prevention Program](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/king-lab/) (Cheryl King)

[Longitudinal study of health and survival in the Dogon of Mali](http://sites.lsa.umich.edu/bis/research/) (Beverly Strassman)

[Sleep Disorders in Youth after Adenotonsillectomy](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ronald_Chervin) (Ronald Chervin)



# Technical Documents

[Last Statements of the Texas Executed](http://micl.shinyapps.io/texEx/texEx.Rmd)     A demonstration of both text analysis and literate programming/document generation with a dynamic and interactive research document. The texts regard the last statements of offenders in Texas.

[Bayesian Basics](../docs/IntroBayes.html)     This serves as a conceptual introduction to Bayesian modeling with examples using R, Stan, and to a lesser extent, BUGS and JAGS.

[Generalized Additive Models](../docs/GAMS.pdf)     An introduction to generalized additive models with an emphasis on generalization from familiar linear models and using the mgcv package in R.

[Mixed Models Overview](../docs/mixedModels.html)  An overview that introduces mixed models for those with varying technical/statistical backgrounds. 

[Introduction to Machine Learning](../docs/mlcrash.pdf)     A gentle introduction to machine learning concepts with some application in R.

[Comparing Measures of Dependency](../docs/CorrelationComparison.pdf)     A summary of relatively recent articles that look at various measures of dependency Pearson's r, Spearman's rho, and Hoeffding's D, and newer ones such as Distance Correlation and Maximal Information Coefficient.

[R for Social Science](../docs/RSocialScience.pdf)   This was put together in a couple of days under duress, and is put here in case someone can find it useful (and thus make the time spent on it not completely wasted).



# Workshops

[Structural Equation Modeling](../docs/sem/) This document regards a recent workshop given on structural equation modeling.  It is conceptually based, and tries to generalize beyond the standard SEM treatment. It is a work in progress, particularly the sections after the SEM 'chapter'.  The initial workshop was given to an audience comprising in-person and remote participants, but the document should be useful to anyone interested in the techniques covered. It is completely R-based, with special emphasis on the [lavaan](http://lavaan.ugent.be/) package.

[Ceci nâ€™est pas une %>%](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/m-clark/data-manipulation-in-r/blob/master/mainSlides.html)     Exploring your data with R. A workshop that introduces some newer modes of data wrangling within R, with an eye toward visualization.
 
Introduction to R     An attempt to orient newcomers to programming in R and make sure they understand what they are getting into. The focus is on getting started quickly with basic operations and knowing how to get help to become self-sufficient as easily as possible. While this assumes no programming background in particular, I will possibly be adding a course for an intro to R that assumes programming experience. Older pdf link.

[Literate Statistical Programming](../docs/RDA_intro.pdf)     A presentation on literate programming and reproducible research. Introduces key concepts with demonstration via Rstudio using markdown, LaTeX, R etc.
