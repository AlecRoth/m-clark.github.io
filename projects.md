Part of my job entails analysis or consulting on various projects in differing levels of involvement. I note those here.

# Past


[Baboon Social Affiliation](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1793/20141261.short) (Beth Archie) This led me down a path in which I've consulted on research involving baboons, macaques, chimps, geladas, etc., which I find can be kind of fun.
