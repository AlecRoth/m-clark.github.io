Some of the things I spend some time on such as research, technical documents, or even just some fun things I might do with some code on the side. Still in progress of migration.

# Workshops

<span itemscope itemtype ="http://schema.org/TechArticle">
[<span itemprop="name keywords">Structural Equation Modeling</span>](../docs/sem/) This document regards a recent workshop given on structural equation modeling.  It is conceptually based, and tries to generalize beyond the standard SEM treatment. It is a work in progress, particularly the sections after the SEM 'chapter'.  The initial workshop was given to an audience comprising in-person and remote participants, but the document should be useful to anyone interested in the techniques covered. It is completely R-based, with special emphasis on the [lavaan](http://lavaan.ugent.be/) package.
