### Background

<span itemprop="description">
While my interest is in statistical science, I started off majoring in [psychology](http://www.psy.tcu.edu/) and [philosophy](http://www.phil.tcu.edu/) as an undergraduate, and eventually obtained a Ph.D. in [Experimental Psychology](http://psychology.unt.edu/graduate-programs/applied-experimental-psychology). During graduate school I became interested in statistics, eventually choosing it as a concentration, and also started consulting at that time. That turned out to be a good fit for me, and I've been analyzing data ever since.</span>

<span itemprop="description">
Previous to my current position, I was a statistical consultant for the [Center for Social Research](http://csr.nd.edu/) at the University of Notre Dame. Before that, I was previously affiliated with the <span itemprop="affiliation alumniOf">University of North Texas</span> with the departments of [Psychology](http://www.psyc.unt.edu/) as lecturer, and [Research and Statistical Support](http://www.unt.edu/rss) as  statistical consultant.</span>


### Current

<span itemprop="description">
Currently I am <span itemprop="jobTitle">Statistician</span> Lead for the [<span itemprop="worksFor memberOf">Advanced Research Computing</span>](http://arc.umich.edu/) consulting group, [<span itemprop="worksFor memberOf">CSCAR</span>](http://cscar.research.umich.edu/), at the [<span itemprop="affiliation workLocation">University of Michigan</span>](https://umich.edu/). I provide analytical, visualization, code, concept, and other support to the larger research community. Analytically speaking, I have a fairly wide exposure to modeling techniques, from traditional models to their extensions dealing with clustered data, temporal, spatial and nonlinear contexts, latent variable models, machine learning techniques, Bayesian approaches, dealing with unstructured data (e.g. text analysis), and so on. I spend most of my programming time in the <span itemscope itemtype ="https://schema.org/ComputerLanguage">R</span> world, with which I have many years of experience using it as my primary programming tool. Lately, I have spent the bulk of my non-R coding with <span itemscope itemtype ="https://schema.org/ComputerLanguage">Python</span> and <span itemscope itemtype ="https://schema.org/ComputerLanguage">Stan</span>. However, I have had exposure to traditional statistical packages, and some more specialized. I also have to consistently dive into web-oriented programming as necessary, e.g. markdown, css and the like, but also using tools like R and Python for web-scraping. I like programming and solving problems with it, and I'm lucky enough to spend regular time simply learning new statistical and programming tricks.</span>



What drew me to the world of statistics and keeps my interest is that it frees me to engage in whatever science I like, and provides a great many tools with which to discover more about the things we humans are most interested in. I can be reached at <micl@umich.edu>. CV can be found [here](../cv.html).
